The next 7 questions (Q9 to Q15) refer to the following definitions.

---
**Definition 1**. A Group, denoted $(G,∗)$, is a set G along with a binary operator ∗ that satisfies these four axioms:

$\quad\quad$ (A1) **<u>Closure</u>**: $∀a,b∈G,a∗b∈G.$

$\quad\quad$ (A2) **<u>Associativity</u>**: $∀a,b,c∈G,(a∗b)∗c=a∗(b∗c).$

$\quad\quad$ (A3) **<u>Identity</u>**: $∃e∈G$ such that $∀a∈G,a∗e=e∗a=a.$

$\quad\quad$ (A4) **<u>Inverse</u>**: $∀a∈G,∃b∈G$ (called the inverse of $a$) such that $a∗b=b∗a=e.$

**<u>Remarks</u>**:
1. It is usual to write $ab$ to mean $a∗b$.

2. Because of Associativity, there is no ambiguity in writing abc, since the result is the same whichever way it is evaluated.

3. The element $e∈G$ is called the identity element, or simply identity.

4. The inverse of $a$ is usually denoted $a^{-1}$.

---
**Definition 2**. If G is finite with $m∈Z^+$ elements, then the group order of G is said to be $m$. For small $m$, it is often helpful to see the group as a Cayley table. Let $a_1,a_2,...,a_m$ be the elements of G, then each entry, $c_{ij}$ in the $m×m$ Cayley table is defined as $c_{ij}=a_ia_j$, for $i,j= 1,2,...,m$ (see Table 1(a) on page 6.)

An example of a group is $(\{true,false\},⊕)$. Its Cayley table is shown in Table 1(b). As you may recall, $⊕$ is the logical exclusive-OR binary operator, which evaluates to true when both its inputs are different, and false otherwise.

To check whether this is a group, let’s see if it satisfies the four axioms. Closure is obvious from the table, and Associativity is guaranteed by the ⊕ operator. From the table, the identity is false, because $true ⊕ false=true$, and $false ⊕ false=false$, thus satisfying Axiom (A3). The last equality also means that false is its own inverse; while $true ⊕ true=false$ means that true is its own inverse too. Thus, $(\{true,false\},⊕)$ is a group since it satisfies all 4 axioms.

(a) General Cayley table

(b) Cayley table for $(\{true,false\},⊕)$

Table 1: Cayley tables.

Another example of a group is the familiar $(ℤ,+)$, that is, the set of integers with the usual addition operator. Closure and Associativity are true for integers under addition, and thus axioms (A1) and (A2) are satisfied. The identity is 0, since $a+0=0+a=a$ for all $a∈ℤ$. Finally, for each $a∈ℤ$, its inverse is $−a$, since $a+(−a)=(−a)+a=0$. Thus, $(ℤ,+)$ is a group. But since $ℤ$ is infinite, it is not possible to draw its Cayley table.

___
**Q9**. Which of the following is a group?

A. $(R,◦)$, where $R=\{R_{120},R_{240},R_{360}\}$, and $R_θ$ means "rotate an equilateral triangle θ degrees clockwise around its center $O$" (see Figure 5), and ◦ means function composition, ie. $R_{θ_2}◦R_{θ_1}$ means "rotate clockwise by $θ_1$, followed by $θ_2$". Its Cayley table is shown below:

_An equilateral triangle is a triangle in which all 3 sides have equal length, and all 3 angles are 60◦_

Figure 5: Rotation of an equilateral triangle by $R_{120}$.

<div align="center">

| ◦         | $R_{120}$ | $R_{240}$ | $R_{360}$ |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| $R_{120}$ | $R_{240}$ | $R_{360}$ | $R_{120}$ |
| $R_{240}$ | $R_{360}$ | $R_{120}$ | $R_{240}$ |
| $R_{360}$ | $R_{120}$ | $R_{240}$ | $R_{360}$ |

</div>

B. $(ℤ,×)$, that is, the set of integers with the multiplication operator.

C. $(\{true,false\},∨)$, whose Cayley table is:

<div align="center">

| ∨       | $true$ | $false$ |
|---------|--------|---------|
| $true$  | $true$ | $true$  |
| $false$ | $true$ | $false$ |

</div>

D. All of the above.

E. None of the above.

___
### Q10. Define three functions as follows:

$f:ℝ→ℝ,\quad ∀x∈ℝ,\quad f(x) =x+ 1.$

$g:ℝ→ℝ,\quad ∀x∈ℝ,\quad g(x) =x− 1.$

$h:ℝ→ℝ,\quad ∀x∈ℝ,\quad h(x) =x.$

Let $F=\{f,g,h\}$, and let ◦ denote function composition, ie. $(f◦g)(x)=f(g(x))$.

Then, $(F,◦)$ is not a group because:

$\quad$ (I) The Closure property is not satisfied.

$\quad$ (II) ◦ is not associative.

$\quad$ (III) There is no identity element inF.

$\quad$ (IV) Not every element inFhas an inverse.

$\quad\quad$ A. (I) only.

$\quad\quad$ B. (IV) only.

$\quad\quad$ C. (I) and (IV) only.

$\quad\quad$ D. (II), (III) and (IV) only.

$\quad\quad$ E. None of A, B, C or D.

___
### Q11. Given a group $(G,∗)$, and from the 4 group axioms (A1) to (A4) alone, it is possible to deduce that all the following statements are true, EXCEPT:

A. (Left cancellation law:) $∀a,b,c∈G,(ab=ac)→(b=c)$.

B. (Uniqueness of inverse:) $∀a,b,b′∈G, ((ab=ba=e)∧(ab′=b′a=e))→(b=b′)$.

C.$∀a,b∈G$, it is always possible to solve for $x∈G$ in $ax=b$.

D. In each row of the Cayley table of G, every $x∈G$ appears exactly once.

E. (Commutative law:) $∀a,b∈G,ab=ba$.

___
**Definition 3**. Given a group $(G,∗)$, and any $x∈G$, define powers of $x$ recursively as follows:

xn=
e(identity), ifn= 0,
x∗xn−^1 , if integern > 0 ,
x−^1 ∗xn+1, if integern < 0.

This means the usual power law holds: $x^{m+n}=x^m∗x^n$ and $(x^m)^n=x^{mn},∀m,n∈Z$.

___
**Definition 4**. For any $x∈G$, let $k$ be the smallest positive integer, if such a $k$ exists, such that $x^k=e$, then the element order of $x$ is said to be $k$.

Define $G_1=\{1,2,3,4\}$ and define ∗ so that $a∗b=a×b$ mod 5, for all $a,b∈G_1$. In other words, $a∗b$ computes the remainder of $a×b$ when divided by 5. Consider the group $(G_ 1,∗)$, whose Cayley table is shown in Table 2.

<div align="center">

| ∗ | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
| 2 | 2 | 4 | 1 | 3 |
| 3 | 3 | 1 | 4 | 2 |
| 4 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 |

Table 2: Cayley table for $(G_1 ,∗)$.

</div>

It is easy to verify that $(G_1 ,∗)$ is indeed a group. Note that $4^3=4∗4∗4=1∗4=4$. Note also that the element order of 2 is 4, since $2^4=2∗2∗2∗2=4∗4=1$, and 4 is the smallest positive integer such that $2^4=1$.

D. $\sqrt{2}$

E. There is no solution.

___
### Q15. Using the Cayley table for $(G_1 ,∗)$, determine $3^{4^{5^{6^7}}}$.

A. 1

B. 2

C. 3

D. 4

E. There is no solution.

### Q18. (12 marks)Group Theory. (Please refer to the Group Definitions 1 to 4 given on pages 5 and 7.) We make one more definition.

___
Definition 5.Two groups,(G,∗) and(H, ), are said to be isomorphic, if and
only if, there exists a bijectionf:G−→Hsuch that:

(Isomorphic property:) ∀x,y∈G, f(x∗y) =f(x) f(y).

Note that in the left hand side of the above equation, the binary operator is that of G, while the right hand side’s binary operator is that ofH. As long as we keep this in mind, we may re-write the property as:

(Isomorphic property:) ∀x,y∈G, f(xy) =f(x)f(y).

We write G∼=Hto denote the fact that groups(G,∗)and(H, )are isomorphic.

Isomorphic groups are, as you may have guessed, “equal” to each other, in the sense that one group (H, ) may be obtained from the other group (G,∗) by:

(i) renaming the elements in G to those in H, and

(ii) renaming the binary operator∗to ,

in such a way that their Cayley tables agree. The bijection f, with the isomorphic property, captures this renaming mathematically.

Define two groups, (G 2 ,×), and (G 3 ,•) by their Cayley tables shown below:

× 1 i −i − 1
1 1 i −i − 1
i i − 1 1 −i
−i −i 1 − 1 i
− 1 − 1 −i i 1

- e a b c
e e a b c
a a e c b
b b c e a
c c b a e
    
(a) (G 2 ,×), where $i=\sqrt{-1}$

(b) (G 3 ,•).

Table 3: Cayley tables.

(a) (2 marks) Compare groups (G 1 ,∗) (defined in Table 2, on page 8), and (G 2 ,×) above. It should be obvious thatG 1 ∼=G 2. Find the bijectionf:G 1 −→G 2 with the isomorphic property that establishes the isomorphism.

(b) (2 marks) Now compare (G 2 ,×) with (G 3 ,•). Explain why G 2 G 3 , ie. they are not isomorphic. (Do not say “because no bijection exists”; instead, explain using some property of the elements of the groups.)

(c) (4 marks) Let’s show that∼=is an equivalence relation onS, the set of groups. It is straightforward to prove reflexivity and transitivity:

Proof (Reflexivity).

1. Take any groupg∈S.
2. The identity functionIg:g−→gsuch thatIg(x) =x,∀x∈g, is a bijection, by Q3(a),
    Assignment #2.
3. Also, clearly,∀x,y∈g, Ig(xy) =xy=Ig(x)Ig(y), by definition ofIg.
4. Thus,Ighas the isomorphic property.
5. Henceg∼=g, and∼=is reflexive.

Proof (Transitivity).
1. Take any three groupsg,h,i∈S.
2. Supposeg∼=handh∼=i:
2.1. Then∃r:g−→hwhich is a bijection with the isomorphic property, by definition of isomorphism.
2.2. Then∃s:h−→iwhich is a bijection with the isomorphic property, by definition of isomorphism.
2.3. Thens◦r:g−→iis also a bijection, by Theorems 7.3.3, 7.3.4 (Epp).
2.4. (To prove isomorphic property:) Take anyx,y∈g.
2.5. Then,s◦r(x)s◦r(y) =s(r(x))s(r(y)), by definition of◦.
2.6. =s(r(x)r(y)), by the isomorphic property ofs.
2.7. =s(r(xy)), by the isomorphic property ofr.
2.8. =s◦r(xy), by definition of◦.
2.9. Thuss◦rhas the isomorphic property.
2.10. Thus,g∼=i.
3. Hence∼=is transitive.

Notice that in these proofs, we needed to (i) find the bijection, and (ii) prove that it possess the isomorphic property. Complete the proof below that∼=onSis symmetric. Fill in the missing 3 (at most 4) steps from Lines 2.5. to 2.8. If you exceed 4 steps, 0 marks will be given. Be sure to justify each step.

Proof (Symmetry).
1. Take any two groupsg,h∈S.
2. Supposeg∼=h:
2.1. Then∃f:g−→hwhich is a bijection with the isomorphic property, by definition of isomorphism.
2.2. Thenf−^1 :h−→gis also a bijection, by Theorem 7.2.3 (Epp).
2.3. (To prove thatf−^1 has the isomorphic property:)
2.4. Take anyx,y∈h.
2.5.
2.6.
2.7.
2.8. (Optional)
2.9. Thusf−^1 has the isomorphic property.
2.10. Thush∼=g.
3. Hence∼=is symmetric.

(d) (4 marks) Prove that for any group (G,∗), with identity elemente, ifGis finite, then ∀x∈G,∃n∈Z+ such thatxn=e.
